        <b>NOTE II</b>
        <br>
         Our staff should be allowed to leave the client's premises as soon as they are done with the house or office chores.                    <br>Clients cannot split the allocated hours for a day into two or more days.

          <b>NOTE III</b>
        <br>
            We also plead with our client to be patient with us in terms of managing their days of service.
            Some days happen to be more busy than others for us .<br>For clients who want their service delivered on saturdays, Only 2 saturdays are available per month.<br><b>WE CANT CLEAN ALL OUR CLIENTS HOMES ON SATURDAYS.</b>    
            We also ask our clients to give  us 24 hours after paying to assign a staff to them so as to assign the perfect staff to you. 
        </p>
             <p>
        <b>NOTE IV</b>
       <br>
            Clients should be careful when choosing days for thier services, because any missed day by the client would have to be carried over to 
            another week if the client contacted the office to notify. If no notication was sent to the staff or office it would be counted as delivered, if our staff was present at the home or location.
         <br>

         <p>
            <b>NOTE V</b>

            Clients must not make any agreement(written or oral) with our staff, without the company's knowledge. 
          ,any of such agreement is at client's risk.
            <br> Any discipliniary action would be taken by the company and not the client. The clients should just report.
        </p>
         <b>NOTE VI</b>
            <br>
                A client that wants to end his/her service should indicate during the current service. Any extra service would be fully paid for.
